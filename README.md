# ITEMAS_English
A version of the Spanish ITEMAS ontology in English
The ITEMAS ontology is an ontology for Healthcare Innovation. The definition on their Bioportal page: https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/ITEMAS/?p=summary  is:
The defined ontology is focused on addressing medical innovation technology in public healthcare institutions. This ontology is currently only in Spanish language. It has been developed the Platform for Innovation Medical and Health Technology (ITEMAS) a network composed by 67 Spanish healthcare organizations (including hospitals, healthcare centers, Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality and more than 100 organizations focused on medical technology innovation. The ITEMAS Platform has been by Carlos III National Health Institute (PT13/0006/0036), both co-funded by FEDER from European Regional Development Funds (European Union).
This version has labels in both Spanish and English. The Spanish labels are on the skos:altLabel property and the English labels are on the rdfs:label property. In the version on Bioportal there are no labels. I used my SPARQL transformations to first generate Spanish labels from the IRIs and then I used SPARQL queries generated by ChatGPT to generate English labels in the rdfs:label property.
